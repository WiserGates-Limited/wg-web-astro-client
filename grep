I want to create a Dialog component that is 
reactive and an island in my island architecture
based website. This Dialog component serves 
the purpose of prompting the user for 
information and in return there's a reward 
in the form of a callback. My users will be 
excited to click a button. It will open this 
Dialog component and give them an immersive 
experience.

--define immersive experience
provide information that we need and in return,
return a piece of information.

--current examples
1. download file
2. request group session
3. set-up online meeting 

?a dialog acts as a platform for any user's action 
on the site. The dialog experience needs to ensure
a optimally happy UX journey leading up to get 
their desired result

open dialog
look at dialog intents (--intent - )
render dialog content
